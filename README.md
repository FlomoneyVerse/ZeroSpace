### Create a zeroverse

Zero space - an infinite empty space where user can create stuff similar to world but dissimilar due to the creative inputs of the user 

User is the creator of the zero space. 

He will get a space with objects that he can place where he wants to

Objects can be animate or inanimate

But there after user loses control of the objects - If animate they can move around, so there space is not limited to the area of creation
